# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles managed with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/). It includes configurations for various applications and tools that I use regularly.

## Installation

To install these dotfiles, run the following command:

```bash
chezmoi init --apply TheChilliPL
```

The secrets are managed by Bitwarden, so you have to have the Bitwarden CLI installed and be logged in.
